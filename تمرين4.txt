When you declare a reference variable (i.e. an object) you are really creating a pointer to an object. Consider the following code where you declare a variable of primitive type int:
int x;
x = 10;
In this example, the variable x is an int and Java will initialize it to 0 for you. When you assign it the value of 10 on the second line, your value of 10 is written into the memory location referred to by x.
But, when you try to declare a reference type, something different happens. Take the following code:
Integer num;
num = new Integer(10);
